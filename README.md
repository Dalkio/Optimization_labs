# Optimization workflow

## Labs
Different ipython notebook labs that allow to study several optimization algorithms.

## Project
The project's goal is to implement SVC:
* With and without noise
* With and without linear separation of the distribution, which leads us to implement different kernels
* With and without cvxopt library, which leads us to eventually implement several optimization algorithms in order to compare them
